            <note type="migrationNotes">Dating: note exact date in composition See Jane and Denis (vel.51): The title is given on 132a and the text itself starts on 132b. At the end, on 136a, there is a note saying that it was copied in 762 in the hand of Ahmad b. M. b. Muthabbit, who took it from the handwriting of the author, who said at the end of the book that he had composed it in Malatya, in Anatolia, on the 9th of Rabî’ al-awwal 602 [AP: Yusuf Agha has 9]. Osman Yahia does not mention this note, although he correctly lists the text as having been copied from an original. The date exactly agrees with that on Yusuf Aga 4868, which is the best copy of the text.[24] But it is not the actual date of composition of the work, which is given in the preface as 599 in Mecca.[25] This opens up the intriguing possibility that Yusuf Aga 4868 was the original from which Ahmad copied this version of Hilyat, although a comparison of the two collections as a whole does not throw up any further obvious correlations. AP: this also raises the possibility that Ibn Muthabbit is given the dates these works were originally copied NOT originally composed... raises an issue.</note>
