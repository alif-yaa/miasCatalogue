            <!-- Stemmatics -->
            <note type="stemmatics">OY lists four mss: he considers it a resumé of RG 297, ʿIqd al-manẓūm , and the mss. are classified in a very confusing way between the two RGs. A quick check of all the mss. shows that they are fundamentally the same work, with some variations. We therefore suggest reclassifying all of them under RG 384. There are no definitive historic mss., although Shehit Ali 1341 is early. OY has Veliyudin 51 as copied from an original, but in our opinion the note refers to the previous work (See Jane Clark and Denis McAuley in JMIAS 36). Nevertheless, the work appears in many early collections and there is a good case for its authenticity.</note>

            <!-- Migration Notes -->
            <note type="migrationNote">Related Item: RG 297 (OY duplicate) Denis and Jane (Vel.51): . Osman Yahia calls it K. ‘Iqd al-manzûm and assigns to it RG 297 along with eight other manuscripts. However, he also assigns RG 384, Madkhal fî’ilm al-hurûf to four of these. This has led to a very confusing situation which requires another article to satisfactorily resolve.[27] The question of the status of the work in Veliyuddin 51, however, can be addressed. Although it has no specific notes attached to it, it may well be covered by the general note on 84a, in which case it would have been copied from an original autograph. On the other hand, it is at the end of the collection and the following work, Istilâhât al-sûfiyya, although it has a note with a copying date (see below), again makes no mention of having been taken from an autograph. In view of the consistent notes throughout the rest of the collection, it may be that these last two works were added slightly later from other sources, and so were not covered by the note on 84a. None of the other manuscripts have a provenance which would definitively establish ‘Iqd al-manzûm as an Ibn ‘Arabî work, and Veliyuddin 51 has therefore been cited as the best source. But on the basis of what we have said above, the evidence is not sufficient to prove authenticity beyond doubt.</note>
