            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p class="body-text">A treatise on the servants of God according to the different character traits (akhlāq)
               of the perfect human being (al-insān al-kāmil). Each servant (ʿabd Allāh) represents
               a spiritual modality symbolised by the association of a Divine Name and the name of
               a particular prophet or saint. The work is in two parts; the first consisting of 50
               ʿabādila divided into five sections, the second of 67. Pablo Beneito supports Michel
               Chodkiewicz in relating the first 114 to the 114 suras of the Qurʾān.</p>
            <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
            <p class="body-text">OY lists 16 mss., at least seven of which can be considered historic. The best is
               Yusuf Aga 4859, a partial holograph with a samāʿ dated 641H. Different copies have
               different numbers of chapters: Ayasofia 4817 and Yusuf Aga 4859 have 117, Shehit Ali
               2826 114, the Cairo printed edition (1969) 96. According to Pablo Beneito, who has
               made a detailed study of the text, 117 is the correct number.</p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p class="body-text">Wise sayings, accompanied by explanatory notes. IA says in the introduction that it
               is a collection of sayings by a certain mystic called ʿAlī al-Kurdī who was ‘smitten
               with divine love’, and he has appended a commentary on these sayings. Claude Addas
               adds: “Al-Ajwiba al-‘Arabiyya fî sharh al-nasâ’ih al-Yûsufiyya est une commentaire
               par Ibn ‘Arabî d’une risâla concernant les devoirs du murîd à l’égard de son shaykh
               rédigée par Yûsuf b. Ibrâhîm al-Shâfi’î sous l’inspiration de la rûhâniya de ‘Alî
               al-Kurdî, un “fou” (muwallah ) notoire de Damas (I.A. l’a rencontré, cf.,Fut., II,
               522, ed. Bûlaq).”</p>
            <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
            <p class="body-text">OY lists five mss. of which two, Husein Celebi 447 and Yusuf Aga 4860, although undated,
               are very early, whilst Yusuf Aga 4860 is from SQ’s library, and is possibly 7th or
               8th century. The internal evidence of the text – for example, the language and the
               mention of his wife – is strong evidence that it is by IA. In addition, the title
               is listed in one of the lists which IA made of his own works, Fihris muʾallafāt al-shaykh
               al-akbar (RG142), and it does not seem to be attributed to anyone else. Claude Addas
               confirms this stating that:: “L’attribution de ce texte à Ibn ‘Arabî ne fait aucun
               doute ; on y trouve de nombreuses références autobiographiques, par ex, l’investiture
               de la khirqa par ‘Abd Allâh b. Jâmī”.A number of the poems in this work appear clustered
               in the Paris Diwan (B.N. 2348) and seemingly nowhere else. Further information on
               the fully digitized text of RG 9 found in Word format at cb.rayaheen.net/userfiles/download.php?id=1395‎,
               which extracts as a Word document with name شرح روحانية الشيخ الكردي.doc. The text
               itself carries a title not listed by Osman Yahia under RG 9, namely: شرح ما نطقت به
               روحانية سيدي علي الكردي . JC has compared that text to Yusuf Aga 4860 and Husein Celebi
               447. The 202 page text in the Word document closely matches the complete text found
               in Husein Celebi 447 ff.1a-149b. Decapitated Yusuf Aga 4860 p.207 – which we estimate
               is missing the first 14 pages (7 folios) – starts with the text found at the end of
               page 11 of the Word document (cf. Husein Celebi f.9a line 2). PDF versions are also
               available via Google (شرح روحانية الشيخ الكردي لسيدي ابن عربي.pdf).</p>

               in Damascus in 621H. According to OY, the work was written in 601H in Jerusalem on
               the basis of a note on Veliyuddin 51, but our investigation shows that no date is
               given. (See Jane Clark and Denis McAuley, Some Notes on the Manuscript Veliyuddin

            <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
            <p class="body-text">A much copied work, verified by at least six historic mss, three of them definitely
               copied from originals. The best are Shehit Ali 1341, written around 724H in Damascus,
               copied from an original by IA and certified by him, and Ayasofya 4875 (probably dated
               705H). OY believed the work was written in Konya in 602H on basis of a note in Veliyuddin
               51 (110b), but further inspection of the note shows that the place of writing is Damascus.

            <p class="body-text">Written after a vision in 595H, this work is devoted to bringing out the role of the
               mahdī – the “rightly guided leader” – and the Seal of the Saints (whom he identifies
               with Jesus), discussing both a prophetic aspect which looks to the unfolding of their
               functions in time, and a mystical aspect which understands them as realities which
               can be realised in the heart of the complete human being.</p>
            <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
            <p class="body-text">Verified by at least four historic mss. The best is Berlin Oct. 3266 (described by
               Gerald Elmore in Islamic Sainthood in the Fullness of Time (Leiden, 1999) pp. 197-199),
               which was written in 597H, and is the oldest known ms. of IA’s. Also excellent is
               Private 1, written in 637H by a well-known disciple, Muḥammad b. ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Anṣāri,
               in Damascus and checked against the original in IA’s hand; however, according to Abrar
               Ahmed Shahi, who has prepared a critical edition of the text, this mss contains only
               about 50% of the work. Another early copy, dated 707H in the Turkish catalogue (http://ktp.isam.org.tr/),
               is Veliyuddin 1743 ff.1-79. Another copy, dated 834H, in Milli Hk 15 ff.12b-43b, is
               available in digital reproduction here: https://www.yazmalar.gov.tr/detay_goster.php?k=77129
               JC notes that most of the poems from ʿAnqāʾ mughrib are also found as a block – and
               as complete poems – in the Dīwān, p. 26-33.</p>

               dated 651H in Aleppo in SQ’s hand. Often confused with another treatise on retreat,
               K. al-Khalwa (RG255) (as OY has done with Yusuf Aga 7838 copy). Other mss listed:

               - dating almost certainly drawn from dates in text not the date of composition.</p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p class="body-text">The function, states and places of the saints who have the spiritual rank of the ‘pole’
               (quṭb). This is a series of chapters on the aqṭāb which became part of the FM chapters
               462-489, with poems up to 557 (corresponding to sifr 17 of 20 in the first recension).</p>
            <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
            <p class="body-text">OY lists only one ms, Koprulu 766, 1-146, which is an early text. It carries no date,
               but evidence suggests that it may date to late 7th century (the scribe is the same
               as that of Farghānī’s Muntahā al-madārik listed here http://41.32.191.214/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=39750,
               dated 704H). We have found a second text in the Ulu Cami library in Bursa, but as
               we have not yet obtained a digital copy, cannot compare the two mss. JC notes discrepancy
               between the text and the added red numbers from ch. 4 onwards: from chapter “five”
               to chapter “sixteen” the red ink number (467-478) is one less than the corresponding
               FM chapter number (ch.468-479); from chapter “seventeen” to “sixty” the red ink number
               (479-522) is four less than the corresponding FM chapter number (ch.483-526); from
               chapter “sixty-one” to “ninety-one” (the last in the ms) there are no red ink numbers
               – and these correspond to FM ch.527-557. In summary, the text of RG 35 K. al-Aqṭāb
               has the appearance of a highly abbreviated version of FM ch.462-557, omitting ch.480-482
               entirely. It is possible that RG 35 is an early form or summary of sifr 17 of the
               first recension text of FM.</p>

            <p class="body-text">There are no historic mss. and all the surviving texts are late, though always attributed

               older. According to Stephen Hirtenstein and Pablo Beneito it is authentic on textual
               grounds, and the lack of early copies is attributed to the work being only copied
               for close disciples, not open diffusion. There is another relatively early manuscript
               of Evradü’l-Eyyami’s-Seb’a (dated 949H or 950H) in Topkapi E.H. 1072 with 42 folios

               bringing out the esoteric meaning of the verses. As IA explains in the preface, he
               wrote it at the request of Badr al-Ḥabashī and Ibn Sawdakīn in Aleppo in 611H because
               it had incited the disapproval of some of the local ʿulamāʾ.</p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p class="body-text">Ibn ʿArabi’s collected poems, containing more than 800 verses, compiled in the last
               years of his life and finished in 634H. There are are several different versions of
               the work, including a six volume holograph of which we do not, at the moment, have
               a complete copy. Research is therefore ongoing to produce a definitive version of
               the whole text. The best-known version is the printed edition produced by Bulaq, which
               only reproduces one volume. An analysis of the different versions can be found in
               Cook/Hirtenstein: The Great Diwān and its offspring; the collection and dispersion
               of Ibn ʿArabī’s poetry, in JMIAS 52, 2012.</p>
            <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
            <p class="body-text">OY lists 28 mss, of which at least four are historic. The best is Khalili 225, which
               is volume (juzʾ) 4 of the holograph, dated 634H in Damascus. The other holographs,
               Yusuf Aga 5502 and 5503, were stolen without being previously microfilmed, so there
               is no access to the texts, although it is believed that Uni 1438 is a copy of the
               first part.</p>

               of his teachings on the meaning of the perfect human being (al-insān al-kāmil). It
               takes the form of 27 chapters on the prophets from Adam to Muhammad, each associated
               with a knowledge; for example; the wisdom on divinity in the word of Adam: the wisdom
               of light in the word of Joseph. Ibn ʿArabī’s intention in the Fuṣūṣ is to draw out
               the interior, saintly wisdom of each prophet rather than the religious law which they
               brought.</p>

               to nearly 10,000 pages in the holograph. It totalises all aspects of his work and
               all the esoteric knowledge of his era. The first recension, completed in Ṣafar 629H,
               exists only in copies, while the second, written between 632H and 636H, survives in
               IA’s own hand (see Evkaf Muzesi 1845+). There is still work to be done in distinguishing
               between the two recensions in the mss base, but considerable progress has been made
               by Julian Cook and Claude Addas in identifying “markers” which indicate the recension
               of any given ms. Their research indicates that many later mss. may be hybrids of the
               two recensions. For details of their work on the two recensions, see ancillary documents.</p>
            <h3>Manuscripts</h3>

               Jerusalem on the basis of a note on Veliyuddin 51, but our investigation shows that
               he has confused the place of copying with the place of writing and in fact, no place

            <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
            <p class="body-text">OY lists four mss: he considers it a resumé of RG 297, ʿIqd al-manẓūm , and the mss.
               are classified in a very confusing way between the two RGs. A quick check of all the
               mss. shows that they are fundamentally the same work, with some variations. We therefore
               suggest reclassifying all of them under RG 384. There are no definitive historic mss.,
               although Shehit Ali 1341 is early. OY has Veliyudin 51 as copied from an original,
               but in our opinion the note refers to the previous work (See Jane Clark and Denis
               McAuley in JMIAS 36). Nevertheless, the work appears in many early collections and
               there is a good case for its authenticity.</p>

               K. Maqṣid al-asmāʿ. According to OY, the same work, entitled Ummuhāt al-maʿārif has

            <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
            <p class="body-text">OY cites 16 mss, although none can be considered historic. There are several ‘families’:
               one is represented by Koprulu 766 (dated by TRF as 632H but we have not been able
               to find evidence for this); another by Princeton Garrett 4098 (dated 949H) and Zahiriyya
               4679 (dated 1305); and the third by Badawi’s edition (and other printed editions).
               There is also a hybrid, Shehit Ali 2796 (undated), connected to the library of M.
               b. Qayṣar who was the head of SQ’s zāwiya. The principal factor in verifying this
               text as by IA is textual, i.e. its correspondence with Fihris muʿallafāt (RG142) and
               the corpus of known IA works.</p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p class="body-text">Work ascribed to IA on the life and qualities of the Prophet, including the palm-tree
               miracle in Seville. The text has been analysed by Pablo Beneito (JMIAS 30, 2001).</p>
            <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
            <p class="body-text">OY cites no surviving mss., but we have inspected an early mss. in Jerusalem (Khalidiyya
               967, 701H, of which there is a microfilm copy in the Dār al-kutub, Cairo.) which carries
               a dedication to IA’s sons and his daughter Fāṭima. This makes it highly likely that
               it is an authentic work. The work is mentioned in both the lists which IA made of
               his own works, Fihris muʾallafāt al-shaykh al-akbar (RG142) and Ijāza li-l-malik al-Muẓaffar
               (RG 269) and internal evidence as presented by Pablo Beneito (see JMIAS 30, 2001)
               supports the verification. There is some confusion between this work and K. al-Shamāʾil
               al-nabī, for which OY lists three mss and assigned a separate RG number (669). But
               our research so far indicates that there is only one work with variant titles. We
               have therefore consolidated under RG 276 and categorised RG 669 as a duplicate.</p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p class="body-text">Small work, in the form of 260 sayings of different contemplatives and spiritual travellers.
               It is divided into seven chapters; the first six on Vision, Hearing, the Word, Union,
               Knowledge and Love, with the seventh, longer, chapter dealing with a diversity of
               subjects. According to OY, based upon the Carullah 986 ms., it was composed in Baghdad,
               but in our reading of the note (see 47b) it is more likely that it was copied or collated
               there.</p>
            <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
            <p class="body-text">OY cites 27 mss., of which at least two can be considered as historic: Beyazid 3750
               (c.782H) which was copied from IA’s original, and Carullah 286 (undated but early)
               which carries a note (see 47b) saying that it was copied and collated against a copy
               which had been read to the author; also Khalidiyya 892 (c.656H)</p>

            <p class="body-text">OY cites four mss., all of them late. According to him, the preface is identical to
               ʿUqlat al-mustawfiz (RG802) but the end differs – our preliminary inspection indicates
               that the beginning is a variant, and it goes up to end of chapter on falak al-kawākib,
               with an extra piece at the end. Similar in content to Chapter 7 in FM. Needs some
               further research to determine whether this is really an independent work.</p>

            <p class="body-text">One of Ibn ʿArabī’s most important minor treatises, this work deals with the fundamental
               premises of his metaphysics; the Divine Essence and Attributes, the human being as
               the intermediary between Creator and Creation, and the author’s conception of the
               Universal Reality (al-haqīqa al-kulliya). Built around a pronounced philosophical
               framework, almost in the kalām style, and copiously illustrated with diagrams and
               tables. (Fenton and Gloton).</p>
            <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
            <p class="body-text">A much copied work, verified by two historic mss.: Manisa 1183 (655H taken from al-Ḥabashī’s
               copy), and Veliyuddin 1686 (c.667 and copied by disciple of SQ’s). We know from its
               mention in al-Tadbīrāt al-Ilāhīya (see Elmore JMIAS 29) that this was one of the first
               works IA began, but the surviving versions are later, probably written in Tunis in
               598/1202 at the home of al-Mahdawī (see FM. Chapter 4).</p>

               3750 (253b), but we could not find any indication of this; it looks as if there has
               been confusion with another work in the same collection.</p>

               carries a note by IA about the composition of the work, that it was written in Ramaḍān
               621H for a known disciple, Sharafuddīn Abū Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Wāḥid b. Abū Bakr b. Sulaymān
               al-Ḥamawī. The earliest copy is Fatih 5298, dated 783H, which also has a colophon
               saying that it is a work by IA and that it was dictated to a student in 621H in Damascus.
               A work of this title is listed in both the lists which IA made of his own works, Fihris
               muʾallafāt al-shaykh al-akbar (RG142) and Ijāza l-il-malik al-Muẓaffar (RG 269), and
               there is a correspondence with other works on the Divine Names (see FM 559).</p>

               on Veliyuddin 51, but our investigation shows that he has confused the place of copying
               with the place of writing. (See Jane Clark and Denis McAuley Some Notes on the Manuscript

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p class="body-text">An intricate treatise describing an elaborate hierarchy of ‘way-stations’ or ‘abodes’
               (see Michel Chodkiewicz, Ocean, 64–67). There are 19 major manāzil, corresponding
               to 19 classes of Qur’anic suras, many of which are sub-divided. The work is also known
               as Kitāb al-fahwāniyya, a technical term designating the Divine Speech addressing
               the servant face to face in the presence of imagination. Here, it denotes the comprehensive
               way-station of basmala, which has 19 letters. The treatise ends with an account of
               the mystical ascent (mirʿāj). See FM I:171-180.</p>
            <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
            <p class="body-text">OY lists 10 mss., with one very good historic ms. verifying the work: the holograph
               Veliyuddin 1759 (618H) with a samāʿ written by Ibn Sawakīn in Aleppo. It also appears
               in other good collections, particularly Beyazid 3750 and Carullah 986. OY dates the
               composition to 603H based on a note at the end of Beyazit 3750 (432a), but we could
               not verify this; it is possible that there is some confusion with a note on another
               work.</p>

               of Niffarī’s Mawāqif. There are two commentaries, one by Ibn Sawdakīn and one by Sitt
               al-ʿAjam, which have been used in a critical Spanish edition and an English translation
               of Mashāhid. There are two associated works; a prologue which is classifed by OY as

               an original dated 596H). Some texts include the prologue (RG 626) and an epilogue.
               We have classified all these under RG 432 as it is too complex to make distinctions.
               Michel Chodkiewicz has examined both the Manisa ms, and the Paris National ms (B.
               N. 6104). He finds a slight difference between them in Ibn ʿArabi’s commentary.</p>

            <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
            <p class="body-text">OY lists three mss., none of which are historic. There are some aspects which point
               towards its being by Ibn ‘Arabī. One ms. (Carullah 2070) quotes IA at the end: “I
               completed it in one day in Mosul,” and a work of this title is listed in both the
               lists which IA made of his own works, Fihris muʾallafāt al-shaykh al-akbar (RG142)
               and Ijāza li-l-malik al-Muẓaffar (RG 269). But Claude Addas has examined the text
               as it appears in the printed Cairo edition, and feels that the internal evidence of
               the text does not permit its attribution to Ibn ‘Arabī. Therefore, in the absence
               of further evidence, it is classified as unverified. Further mss identified by JC:

            <p class="body-text">Written for IA’s close companion, Badr al-Ḥabashī, this is said to be the book that
               explains what all spiritual masters need to teach. It describes three degrees of surrender
               (islām), faith (īmān) and true goodness (iḥsān), according to three levels of realisation.
               It includes a detailed discussion of how all the members and faculties of the human
               being participate in the Divine Praise.</p>

               dated 712H. Brocklemann, according to OY, thinks it is apocryphal and should be attributed
               to Dhahabī (d.748) (see OY p. 397). But there is textual evidence that it is by IA:
               Claude Addas, in her biography of IA Quest for the Red Sulphur (Cambridge, 1993),
               refers to several passages where incidents are described which correspond to information
               in other verified texts; eg. pp. 211, 223, 227. Also, a work of this title is mentioned
               in both the lists which IA made of his own works, Fihris muʾallafāt al-shaykh al-akbar
               (RG142) and Ijāza li-l-malik al-Muẓaffar (RG 269). Michel Chodkiewicz relates that
               some years ago he saw an autograph copy, written in Malatya, which is in private ownership
               in Tunisia, but we have not yet been able to obtain a copy of this. Other mss identified:

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p class="body-text">Autobiographical sketches of IA’s masters in al-Andalus, a companion volume to his
               Rūḥ al-quds (RG 639). This work was written in Andalusia, and therefore there are
               no extant manuscripts of the original work. However, Ibn ʿArabī rewrote a version
               of the text later for a friend in Damascus, and this is the text, entitled K. Mukhtaṣar
               al-Durra al-fākhira, that we now have. Abrar Ahmad adds: Shaykh Ibn Arabi says in
               the first paragraph of this Mukhtaṣar al-Durra al-Fākhira: سألني بعض من يكرم علي من
               إخواني بمحروسة دمشق أن أوقفه على كتاب أودعته ذكر بعض من لقيته فانتفعت به في طريق الأخرة
               فلم يكن عندي حاضرا عند سواله فإني تركته بالمغرب فقيدت له هذا المختصر في ذكر بعض المشيخة؟
               من أهل الله المتمكنين في طريق أهل التحقيق من الصالحين العارفين رضي الله عنهم جميعهم
               مستعينًا بالله تعالى ولم أذكر فيه إلا من لقيته ورأيته وصحبته من رجال ونساء وكبير في
               السن وصغير على قدر ما تذكرت منهم في هذا الوقت. وذكرت على كل واحد منهم حكاية رأيتها
               منه من كلام حكمة أو خرق عادة أو موعظة و تركت منهم كثيرا أضعاف ما ذكرت. (مختصر الدرة
               الفاخرة - الصفحة الأولي للمخطوط)</p>
            <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
            <p class="body-text">There are only two extant mss.: one, Esad Ef. 1777, is listed by OY as Al-durrat al-fākhira
               (RG 105) and is late (1006H); the other OY lists as RG 496, K. Mukhtaṣar al-durrat
               al-fākhira in Veliyuddin 1800. OY lists Esad Efendi under both classifications, and
               Veliyuddin 1800/186-201B, under RG 496 only. We would suggest that they should both
               be under RG 496. The Veliyuddin ms. is early (715H) and presumably the source for
               Esad Ef. The main factor in considering this a verified work is the correlation with
               the well-verified work Rūḥ al-quds (RG 639) and the fact that it relates many of the
               same incidents.</p>

               was written in 601H in Jerusalem on the basis of notes on Veliyuddin 51 and Bayazid
               3750. But our investigation of Vel. 51 shows that he has confused the place of copying
               with the place of writing and in fact, the note says it was written in Damascus in
               602H. Bayazid 3750 likewise does not mention Jerusalem, but confirms the date of Jumādā
               l-ūlā 602H. (See Jane Clark and Denis McAuley Some Notes on the Manuscript Veliyyudin

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p class="body-text">A collection of 21 poems written in the muwashshaḥ style – a specifically Andalusian
               form of poetry which was common to the Muslims, Jews and Christians of the region.</p>
            <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
            <p class="body-text">There is only one copy of this text, Shehit Ali 1389 (c.777H), which has a note saying
               it was taken from a copy in the hand of IA. There was also a copy now lost in Yusuf
               Ağa 5503. A comparison with the muwashshaḥāt in the Bulaq Dīwān reveals that the 21
               poems in the ms. are all in the Great Dīwān, although the order in which they are
               presented is different and there are minor textual variations. It is therefore unclear
               whether this is an extract from some version of the Dīwān, or an earlier version of
               a work which was later incorporated into it, so for the time being it is regarded
               as a stand-alone work.</p>

            <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
            <p class="body-text">OY lists nine mss., verified by one definitive historic ms. and one other: Manisa
               1183 (c.650H, from an original in the hand of IA) and the undated Husein Celebi 477.
               There is some confusion in OY between this and RG 454, Miftaḥ al-Fuṣūṣ. Some have
               thought that the commentary is actually by Ibn Sawdakīn (see OY p. 407), but the Husein
               Celebi ms states that it is by the author of the Fuṣūṣ, i.e. IA.</p>

               by one of his known students, and is definitive in attributing it to him. OY says
               that the author quotes an event in 631H which would support the possibility of attribution.

               536/1141 in Marrakesh). The work is also known as R. al-Nashʾatayn (RG 533, as given
               in both the lists which IA made of his own works, Fihris muʾallafāt al-shaykh al-akbar
               (RG142) and Ijāza li-l-malik al-Muẓaffar (RG 269)). This correspondence was exchanged
               before the final departure of IA for the East in 598H (see the preface to the text
               and Rūḥ al-Quds (RG 639) (OY))</p>
            <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
            <p class="body-text">OY lists four mss., of which only one can be considered historic: Veliyuddin 1686
               (c.667H, copied by a disciple of SQ’s in Konya). The basis for its status as verified
               text is the fact that the three poems it contains are all in the Paris Dīwān (BN 2348).
               This work has a variant title of R. al-Nashʾatayn for which OY has created a separate
               RG (533), which is listed in both the lists which IA made of his own works, Fihris
               muʾallafāt al-shaykh al-akbar (RG142) and Ijāza li al-malik al-Muẓaffar (RG 269).
               However, we have consolidated the mss. under RG 611, as it is the title which appears
               most frequently on the mss. themselves.</p>

            <p class="body-text">A much copied work, of which there are three early mss. though none are definitive.
               The best is probably Shehit Ali 1341 (c.725H, a good collection with several works
               taken from originals in the hand of IA). However, the note at the end of this work
               says “taken from an original” without specifying its nature, so it is not certain
               that it was in IA’s hand. The case for regarded this as a verified work rests on the
               internal evidence of the text. JC has identified other copies: Kastamonu 2183 fols
               31a-31b (704H); Köprülü, Fazıl Ahmed Pş., ??, 87-92 s (739H?)</p>

               the way in which the soul is educated and advised by the Holy Spirit through the example
               of previous generations, present-day masters and by direct inspiration. The middle

               was translated by R W J Austin in the 1970s and published as Sufis of Andalusia (London,

               Marrakesh). He claimed to be the Mahdī, and organised an anti-Almoravid rebellion
               in the Algarve. IA claims to have met his son in 590H. IA was very critical of his
               ideas in this work. See Addas Quest for the Red Sulphur, (Cambridge, 1993. pp. 55-7)
               for more on both the original and the commentary.</p>
            <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
            <p class="body-text">OY lists five mss., of which we have investigated four. The work is verified by three
               historic works: Shehit Ali 1174 (741H, copied from an original riwāya Ibn Sawdakīn),
               Veliyuddin 1673 (677H) and Yusuf Ağa 7838 (640H from SQ’s library). There is also
               a work of the same title attributed to ʿAbd Allah Bosnevi (d. 1054/1644) which has
               caused some confusion.</p>

               (The Secrets of Secrets) by pseudo-Aristotle concerning the nature of government,
               with IA adding a spiritual dimension to the discussion. In 21 chapters, it explains
               the correspondences between the external political hierarchy of princes and rulers,
               and the inner rulership of the spirit within the human being.</p>

            <p class="body-text">Long poem with the end rhyme in tāʾ, with commentary by Bosnevi.</p>
            <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
            <p class="body-text">OY lists four mss., of which none are historic. All texts are relatively late and
               without special provenance, so it must be considered unverified. Ryad Atlagh is convinced
               that it is authentic and has presented his arguments in a paper The Phenomenology
               of the Perfect Man in The Tāʾiyya of Ibn ʿArabī (unpublished, MIAS Symposium, Oxford
               1998). All copies we have seen are attributed to IA (varying in length but at least
               400 verses). A line-by-line commentary by Abdullah Bosnevi entitled Qurrat ʿayn al-shuhūd
               also testifies to its authorship by IA. In light of the importance given by Bosnevi
               to this poem, it is most likely that the original Tāʾiyya should be considered as
               an authentic work. Critical edition by Yusuf ‘Awda (Cairo, 2015)</p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p class="body-text">61 mystical love poems to the Divine Beauty, in the qaṣīda form of pre-Islamic poetry.
               According to Pablo Beneito (Qurrat al-ʿAyn, 2020), the original collection was 60
               odes, to which were added first one then two poems in the preface. It was composed
               in 611H in Mecca, although the inspiration came in 604H in the meeting with Qurrat
               al-ʿAyn.</p>
            <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
            <p class="body-text">A much copied work, both on its own and with the commentary (RG116). There are no
               definitive historic mss. to verify the text in its own right, but there are several
               for the commentary, which includes the text of the poems. The best copies are therefore
               contained within mss. of Dhakhāʾir . The best stand-alone mss. are Manisa 6596 (undated,
               taken from SQ’s copy), and Ragib Pasha 1453 (although very late, probably also taken
               from SQ’s copy). There is an issue with the preface on this work. There are two basic
               variants; some mss carry the same preface as the commentary, Dhakhāʾir al-alāq (RG
               116. Others have a longer version which begin with a khutba and IA’s account of meeting
               the young girl, Niẓam, who inspired the poems in Mecca. The situation is complex,
               with several other variants appearing in some mss (see Jane Clark Mystical Perception
               and Beauty: Ibn ʿArabī’s Preface to Tarjumān al-Ashwāq in JMIAS 55, 2013).</p>

            <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
            <p class="body-text">OY lists only one ms., Ayasofia 376 (997H), on which the Hyderabad 1948 Rasāʾil Ibn
               ʿArabi is based. Julian Cook argues that this is a distinct work from RG 821 (of which
               RG 817 is a duplicate). He has identified that within the text there are three poems
               (pp. 2, 5 and 7), each of which is also found in ch. 560 of Futuhat – also known as
               RG 818 Waṣāyā (or even Waṣiyya). So it could well be this work is in fact a set of
               extracts from there. Further investigation required.</p>
